I have been working with multiple outstanding research interns and am always looking for enthusiastic and talented ones. <span style="color:red">Unlike many easy research opportunities, I take the training of research interns seriously</span>: I provide thoughtful and comprehensive academic guidance to research interns who are deeply committed to their research. Many outstanding research intern alumni in my lab have published top-tier research papers (see [Alumni Highlights at RAI Lab](https://yushundong.github.io//students/))—often their very first top-tier research publications in their academic career!
