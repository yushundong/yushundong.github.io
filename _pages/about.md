I am a Lecturer in the [School of Computer Science and Information Security](http://www.gdufe.edu.cn/) at [Guilin University of Electronic Technology](http://www.gdufe.edu.cn/), where I obtained my Ph.D. degree. My research focuses primarily on **fairness** and **privacy protection** in Graph Neural Networks (GNNs).


**(i) Research Summary:** My research interests mainly lie in achieving responsible AI, with a particular focus on **fairness** and **privacy protection** in Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). I have conducted extensive work on these topics, particularly in the context of **graph-based models** and **algorithmic fairness**. I have published 30+ research papers, including several first-author publications, in areas such as:

* **Fairness in Graph Neural Networks:** Fairness measurement, algorithmic debiasing, and model interpretability  
* **Privacy Protection in Graph Neural Networks:** Privacy-aware GNN models and adversarial defense  
* **AI/ML Applications:** Healthcare; Criminal Justice; Finance
