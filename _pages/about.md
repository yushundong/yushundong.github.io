I am an Assistant Professor in the [Department of Computer Science](https://www.cs.fsu.edu) at [Florida State University](https://www.fsu.edu/), where I serve as the founder and director of [RAI (Responsible AI) Lab](https://yushundong.github.io//students/). Prior to that, I obtained my Ph.D. degree from the [University of Virginia](http://www.virginia.edu/), where I was fortunate to work with [Prof. Jundong Li](https://jundongli.github.io).

<span style="color:red">**\[Recruiting PhDs & Interns\]:**</span> I am actively seeking ambitious students for Ph.D. or research intern roles. Please [email me](mailto:yd24f@fsu.edu) with your CV, transcripts, and brief descriptions of your preferred research topics. Kindly mark the subject with `[PhD Application]` or `[Research Intern Application]`. <span style="color:red">**Magic Word**</span>: Please add `appoggiatura` in the email subject to ensure attention and to show that you have read this carefully.  

**Research Summary:** My research interest mainly lies in achieving responsible AI that directly contributes to critical AI infrastructures and enhances collaborative innovations for the industry, with a particular focus on Machine Learning as a Service (MLaaS). I have abundant research works under related topics with a particular focus on relational data, including **40+ published research papers (14 first-author ones)** in the following areas [[see full list]](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=_QUhuOMAAAAJ):


* **AI Security & Privacy:** Attack and Defense in MLaaS; Privacy Protection
* **AI Integrity:** Value Alignment; Knowledge Editing
* **AI Explainability:** Mechanistic Interpretability; Outcome Attribution
