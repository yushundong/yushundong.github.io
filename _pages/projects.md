    <h3>Political-LLM</h3>
    What if large language models (LLMs) could transform how we understand politics? This project introduces Political-LLM, the first comprehensive framework to systematically integrate LLMs into political science research. It bridges computer science and political science by providing a taxonomy, technical insights, and ethical considerations to guide impactful LLM applications in the political domain.

    <h3>PyGDebias</h3>
    PyGDebias aims to provide a systematic schema to load datasets and compare different debiasing techniques for graph learning algorithms. Specifically, 26 graph datasets (including 24 commonly used ones and two newly constructed ones, AMiner-L and AMiner-S) are collected, and 13 algorithms are implemented in this library.
