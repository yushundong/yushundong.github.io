    I lead the Responsible AI (RAI) Lab at Florida State University, Tallahassee, FL. This logo, where the "R" is placed in front of "AI", was conceptualized to emphasize that making AI responsible is even more important than developing AI technology itself. I am truly fortunate to work with such talented and enthusiastic PhD students and research interns listed below.

## RAI Activities

RAI Lab has been hosting [**Student Seminar at Computer Science Department**](https://www.cs.fsu.edu/seminars/) since 2024, providing the students in FSU a wonderful platform to meet peers who are interested in various research topics, mentors who are recruiting students (e.g., PhD students, interns, GTAs, and GRAs), and leadership personnel sharing wonderful achievements of the FSU Computer Science Department. We will provide **free lunch** at each of the seminars and invite speakers to share their state-of-the-art research progress and their personal journey experience. **Come and join us for presentation, discussion, or just lunch!**
